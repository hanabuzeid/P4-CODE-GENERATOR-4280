CODE GENERATION P4
____________________________

STORAGE = GLOBAL

____________________________ 

The program is to parse the input, generate a parse tree, perform static semantics, and then generate a target file. Any error should display detailed message, including line number if available (depending on scanner). Since P1-P3 were already tested, this focuses on testing P target code and and storage allocation. Testing will be performed by running the generated targets to assess if the runtime benhavior is correct.

Ive added a badtest file to see how the outcome is, all the other files are good files and files that will still generate even which a semantics error :) i enjoyed both your classes!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
